# Experiment log: GENCO power-flow surrogate on ENWL1

## How to read this log

All metrics are in physical units from `python -m gencodoe.evaluate`:

- **Vm** in pu, **Va** in degrees;
- **loading** as a fraction of the rating, from voltages via Kirchhoff's current law (KCL);
- **false-safe** = a state that truly violates a limit but is predicted to be fine.

"val" means val-day states, never used for weights or the normalizer. Calibration and test days are separate datasets.

**Balanced vs unbalanced.** Every number here is for the balanced positive-sequence ENWL1 model. Truth is datakit's AC solution (PowerModels), which matches our sweep to within 6e-8 pu. The unbalanced OpenDSS check is not done yet.

## E0: physics + MSE, stock model (14 Oct, laptop)

- **Config.** `0.1 LayeredWeightedPhysics + 0.9 MaskedBusMSE`; random split over 20k training-day states; 44 epochs.
- **Result.** Collapse toward zero voltage. On val days: Vm MAE 0.986 pu, Va MAE 8.7°.
- **Why.** Measured, not assumed:
  - Normalizer baseMVA is 2.1 kW, so normalized admittances are 1e3–3e5.
  - At the true AC solution the graphkit physics residual is 0.02, so the data and physics agree.
  - A non-uniform voltage error of 1e-3 pu gives residuals far above the residual of the all-zero-voltage state (33). With these scales the physics loss rewards the trivial solution.
- **Artifacts.** `mlruns/702338596317565606/2b68b49cf7c44ba3ac92b580c2e1156b`.

## Finding 1: the stock edge encoder cannot see impedance magnitude

- graphkit's edge encoder is Linear → LeakyReLU → Linear → LayerNorm. With inputs of order 1e4 the biases are negligible, so it is positively homogeneous and LayerNorm cancels |Y|.
- Multiplying every admittance by 10 changes the edge embedding by 0.2% (cosine similarity 1.000000), at random init and in the trained E0 model alike.
- So the stock model cannot tell a long cable from a short one.
- Covered by `tests/test_genco.py::test_lv_edge_encoder_sees_impedance_magnitude_stock_does_not`.

## Finding 2: flows from predicted voltages must use KCL

- For E0-like predictions, (v_parent − v)/z gives loading MAE 1.7: a 1e-4 pu voltage error over a short LV segment is an O(100%) flow error.
- `feeder.branch_flows_kcl` rebuilds each branch current from the downstream injections, so the error is O(dV).
- The evaluator, `GencoOracle` and conformal calibration all use KCL.

## Finding 3: real meter states do not reach export congestion

- v1 data (20k train/val, 3k calib, 3k test):
  - undervoltage 4–5% of states;
  - line overload 3–4%;
  - **overvoltage 0%**;
  - **transformer overload 0%**.
- The DOE search evaluates "every customer at level L" rows, which sit outside this distribution.
- v2 data adds such rows to half of the states. Export is up to 5 kW and import up to 7.4 kW per connection; these caps are assumptions.
- v2 coverage, consistent across splits:

  | Condition | Share of states |
  |---|---|
  | undervoltage | 23% |
  | overvoltage | 7.5% |
  | line overload | 36% |
  | transformer overload | 15% |
  | reverse flow | 30% |

- 1–1.5% of v2 states fail datakit's OPF step at extreme import.
- datakit then renumbers `scenario`. The draw ↔ state join now uses `load_scenario_idx`; there is a regression test for it.

## Baselines (1,000 val-day states, v1)

| Predictor | Vm MAE | Vm p99 | Vm max | Va MAE (°) | Loading MAE | False-safe / violating | Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| flat 1.0 pu | 0.0144 | 0.0585 | 0.120 | 0.092 | 2.3e-4 | 32/63 | — |
| train-day mean | 0.0093 | 0.0494 | 0.099 | 0.065 | 1.5e-4 | 31/63 | — |
| LinDistFlow | 3.8e-4 | 0.0033 | 0.0122 | — | 2.3e-4 | 10/63 | 0.03 s |
| fixed point, 1 iteration | 3.8e-4 | 0.0033 | 0.0122 | 0.0009 | 8.8e-6 | 8/63 | 0.02 s |
| exact AC sweep | 1e-9 | 2e-8 | 5e-8 | 1e-8 | 1e-11 | 0/63 | 0.3–0.4 s |

## Stage C screen

- **Setup.** 4,000 train-day and 1,000 val-day states (v1); MaskedBusMSE only; 15 epochs; Apple M4/MPS.

| Run | Variant | Vm MAE | Vm p99 | Va MAE (°) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| q_stock12 | stock, 12 layers | 0.0107 | 0.051 | 0.26 | fails G3a (worse than train mean) |
| q_lv12 | asinh edge/residual encoders, 12 layers | 0.0119 | 0.057 | 0.45 | fails G3a |
| q_lv12_prior | + linear prior (zero-init head, scale 1e-3) | see below | | | |

- **First attempt at q_lv12_prior.** The head was not zero-initialised and the prior was added unscaled. Val MSE started at 1.2e-3, about 2,000× worse than the prior alone, because the random head swamped the prior.
  - Fix: zero-initialise the last layer and add 1e-3 × head output. An untrained model now reproduces the prior exactly.
  - The aborted run is kept in `mlruns/436740004777710085`.

## Runtime context

- The exact AC sweep solves about 2,500–4,000 states/s on one M4 CPU core for this feeder.
- A full test day of hourly export+import envelopes (20 scenarios, k = 4 levels per round) took 30 s in total with AC. The single-feeder 3-minute budget is met without a surrogate.
- LinDistFlow import envelopes on the same day were **unsafe**: P(ok) under exact AC on fresh draws went down to 0.0 in the worst hour.
